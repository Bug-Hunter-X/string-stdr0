# Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string' in TypeScript
This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when passing an array of strings to a function that expects a single string argument. The error message will be: 'Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.
The solution involves either modifying the function to accept an array or modifying the function call to pass a single string.
